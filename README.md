**Is this official?**

Paradise Lost stands to be a new Skylands Dimension mod, inspired by the legendary Aether mod and seeking to grant great, fresh adventures.

**What is Paradise Lost?**

Let me tell you a tale of a land in the sky, a hostile paradise lost to time. ...

These old skylands are shattered world set on a canvas of clouds, painted with dreamy colors, cast upon a new dawn.
This world is a host to a great many creatures, peoples, and places, amidst the sea of clouds you may find
landscapes unlike any you've seen before, dungeons filled with trap and treasure, and hamlets that may make a for a goody home.
Gaze upon the horizon as a new dawn breaks over this olden land, allow yourself to get lost in the endless expanse, let your heart guide you.

Gaze upon the moon as you wander amidst snow, song, and sand, remembering the home you left behind but never looking back.
For what does homesickness say forthwith about a man when wonders lay abound at each crevice...
Regardless, why are you still here? Go venture out! I am not going to tell you the whole story, go find it out yourself!
After all...
An explorer must explore.
